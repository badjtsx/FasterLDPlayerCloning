# Instructions

>[!NOTE]
> It's not "Click of a button" faster but still it's faster than doing it in LDMultiPLayer. You can do it yourself by copy pasting the Instance and its config file manually. (Using the batch file i was able to clone an instance once in 18-19 seconds, using LDMultiplayer took 39-40 seconds).

### Cloning once

Run CloneLDPlayer.bat, it'll ask for an ID which you can find in LDMultiPLayer (You can obviously use the other bat file and choose to clone once but still).

### Clone multiple times

Run CloneLDPlayerMulti.bat, it'll also ask for an ID and the amount of times you want to clone.
